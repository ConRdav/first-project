            <h2> About Us</h2>
            <br>
            <p>We are a community driven 5-a-side league based in Fake Place, England where we have been established since 2019. It has been our main focus to bring football to people of all ages, backgrounds, and beliefs in a safe enviroment where they are encouraged to build new friendships and have fun. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Who is allowed to join?</h2>
            <br>
            <p> We have leagues for males, females and we also offer leagues with mixed gender teams. We run leagues for all age groups which breaks down into age brackets. These are ages 5-8, 9-12, 13-15 and 16+. We also run a league for over 50s so there is no excuses for you to not get involved.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The league runs for a total of 12 weeks twice a year. From Sep 1 - Dec 1 and Mar 1- Jun 1. You'll play 4 games a week on your leagues specific day (see league timings below). The games are 6 minute halfs with a 5 minute half-time. The top 4 teams with the most wins by the final week will go into a knockout tournament to see who wins the league and the bragging rights.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>It costs Â£30 per team for the 12 week league. This money goes toward the maintenance of the football pitches and the reward ceremony at the end for the league champions.</p>
