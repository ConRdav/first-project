 ### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature I would like to implement in the future is a FAQ section to limit the amount of questions left unanswered for the user.
- I would like to add a navigation system for the slideshow instead of it being on a loop however I would need use javascript to achieve this.



## Testing 

![Responsiveness Display](/assets/images/responsive.webp)
- The header and navigation bar is responsive on all screens. However the logo was removed on screen sizes 320x480px as the text was uneligble if it was kept.

- The about us page is responsive and its style is similar on screen sizes. As shown in the image below.
![Responsiveness About Page](/assets/images/responsive-about.webp)

-The gallery page is responsive on all screen sizes apart from 320x480px in the image below it looks repsponsive but on the deployed site the header is pushed to the right hand side along with the footer.
